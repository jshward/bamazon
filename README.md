## A CLI ordering thingie!
#### Which doesn't do anything just shows that I kinda get MySQL

Run the included program through nodejs. It should give you a list of charming items to purchase. 
Then it should ask you which you would like to purchase.
If you choose wisely, it will ask you how many you'd like.
If you choose poorly, it will mock you.

If you choose a valid quantity to order, your order will placed and you will be given your total and a shipping estimate.
If you fail to choose the right quantity, you will be mocked.

If you try to use the quit command to close the connection, it will, fail as I have yet to immplement such a command(AKA Known Issue).
